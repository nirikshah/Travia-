        "AWS": "I can provide you with a variety of simple Python code examples. Here are a few:\n\n### 1. Hello World\n\nThis is the most basic Python program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the screen.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n### 2. Basic Variables\n\nPython has a variety of built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Here's an example of how to use them:\n\n```python\n# Assign values to variables\nname = \"John\"\nage = 30\nheight = 1.75\nis_adult = True\n\n# Print the values\nprint(\"Name:\", name)\nprint(\"Age:\", age)\nprint(\"Height:\", height)\nprint(\"Is Adult?\", is_adult)\n```\n\n### 3. Basic Math Operations\n\nPython supports a variety of basic math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.\n\n```python\n# Assign values to variables\na = 5\nb = 3\n\n# Perform math operations\nresult_addition = a + b\nresult_subtraction = a - b\nresult_multiplication = a * b\nresult_division = a / b\nresult_modulus = a % b\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Addition:\", result_addition)\nprint(\"Subtraction:\", result_subtraction)\nprint(\"Multiplication:\", result_multiplication)\nprint(\"Division:\", result_division)\nprint(\"Modulus:\", result_modulus)\n```\n\n### 4. Conditional Statements\n\nPython supports if-else statements to make decisions based on conditions. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Assign value to variable\nage = 30\n\n# Check if age is greater than 18\nif age > 18:\n    print(\"You are an adult.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n```\n\n### 5. Loops\n\nPython supports for and while loops to execute code repeatedly. Here's an example of a for loop:\n\n```python\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Iterate over the list using a for loop\nfor number in numbers:\n    print(number)\n```\n\n### 6. Functions\n\nPython functions allow you to group a set of statements together to perform a specific task. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define a function\ndef greet(name):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Call the function\ngreet(\"John\")\n```\n\n### 7. Lists\n\nPython lists are a collection of values that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Append a new value to the list\nnumbers.append(6)\n\n# Insert a new value at a specific position\nnumbers.insert(0, 0)\n\n# Remove a value from the list\nnumbers.remove(1)\n\n# Print the list\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\n### 8. Tuples\n\nPython tuples are immutable collections of values that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a tuple of numbers\nnumbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\n### 9. Dictionaries\n\nPython dictionaries are mutable collections of key-value pairs. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary\nperson = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"height\": 1.75\n}\n\n# Access a value in the dictionary\nprint(person[\"name\"])\n\n# Update a value in the dictionary\nperson[\"age\"] = 31\n\n# Print the dictionary\nprint(person)\n```\n\n### 10. Strings\n\nPython strings are sequences of characters. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a string\ngreeting = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Print the string\nprint(greeting)\n\n# Access a character in the string\nprint(greeting[0])\n\n# Update a character in the string\ngreeting = \"Hello, Python!\"\n\n# Print the string\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nNote: This is just a small sample of what you can do with Python.

Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define a function\ndef greet(name):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Call the function\ngreet(\"John\")\n```\n\n### 7. Lists\n\nPython lists are a collection of values that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a list of numbers\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Append a new value to the list\nnumbers.append(6)\n\n# Insert a new value at a specific position\nnumbers.insert(0, 0)\n\n# Remove a value from the list\nnumbers.remove(1)\n\n# Print the list\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\n### 8. Tuples\n\nPython tuples are immutable collections of values that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a tuple of numbers\nnumbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n# Print the tuple\nprint(numbers)\n```\n\n### 9. Dictionaries\n\nPython dictionaries are mutable collections of key-value pairs. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a dictionary\nperson = {\n    \"name\": \"John\",\n    \"age\": 30,\n    \"height\": 1.75\n}\n\n# Access a value in the dictionary\nprint(person[\"name\"])\n\n# Update a value in the dictionary\nperson[\"age\"] = 31\n\n# Print the dictionary\nprint(person)\n```\n\n### 10. Strings\n\nPython strings are sequences of characters. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Create a string\ngreeting = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Print the string\nprint(greeting)\n\n# Access a character in the string\nprint(greeting[0])\n\n# Update a character in the string\ngreeting = \"Hello, Python!\"\n\n# Print the string\nprint(greeting)\n```\n\nNote: This is just a small sample of what you can do with Python. There are many more features and libraries available.",
